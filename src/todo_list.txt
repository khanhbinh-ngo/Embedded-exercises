Todolist:
1. materials checked
    a. soil sensor @Lab
        Need: 2
        Current: 0
    b. air sensor @Binh
        Need: 1
        current: 1
    c. Water check sensor: @Binh
        need: 1
        current: 1
    d. model materials:
        need: dozen works
        Current: no
    e. power source: @Duy
        need: 1
        current: 1
    f. battery holder:
        need: 1
        current: 0 (lab may have)
    g. water pump: @Duy
        need: 1
        current: 1
    h. water pipe: @Duy
        need: 1
        current: 1
    i. etc...
2. materials test
    - test each sensor or device works or not
    - test if they can catch and send data to local

3. step by step coding
    pre. check all devices are ready to fukt. 
    a. test sensor and device work
        - each sensor has it own report 
            + how it works and what they do
    b. try to receive data from data 
        - test each sensor is needed
    c. use data to trigger device
        - test several times are needed
    d. write report and film demo-video

predicted time: 2 weeks
